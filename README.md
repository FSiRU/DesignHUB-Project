Project Overview: User Registration and Authentication System
This project involves the development of comprehensive user registration and sign-in pages seamlessly integrated with a back-end database to manage user details efficiently. The primary aim is to create a secure and user-friendly system that allows new users to register and existing users to sign in with ease.

Key Features:
1. User Registration Page:
   A well-designed and intuitive user interface for new users to sign up.
   Input fields for essential user information such as name, email address, password, and user account type.
   Client-side validation using HTML5 to ensure data integrity and provide instant feedback.
   Integration of an image from the URL Signup Image to enhance the visual appeal.
   
2. User Sign-In Page:
   A straightforward and secure sign-in interface for returning users.
   Input fields for email and password, with validation to ensure correct format and completeness.

3. Technologies Used:
   Frontend:
   HTML: Used for structuring the web pages and form elements.
   CSS: Applied for styling the pages to create a visually appealing and responsive design.

   Backend:
   PHP: Utilized server-side scripting to handle form submissions, interact with the database and manage user sessions securely.

   Database:
   MySQL: Chosen for its reliability and efficiency in storing and retrieving user information. Tables were created to store user credentials, profiles, and other related data securely.

5. Security Measures:
   Password Hashing: User passwords are hashed before being stored in the database to ensure they are not stored in plain text.
   SQL Injection Prevention: Prepared statements and parameterized queries are used to prevent SQL injection attacks.
   Validation and Sanitization: Input data is thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent XSS attacks and ensure data integrity.

Project Outcome:
The project successfully created a functional and secure user registration and sign-in system, providing a robust foundation for managing user authentication. The integration of HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL ensured a cohesive and efficient application with a strong focus on user experience and security.
